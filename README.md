# IT Specialist Certification Python Study Guide


This is a work in progress. The ITS Certtification suite consists of a number of certifications in a variety of topics. For more details, please visit: [ITS Certification at Certiport](https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Certifications/ITSpecialist/Certification/Certify.aspx). 

## ITS: Python
Students preparing for the ITS Python exam should be able to recognize and write syntactically correct Python code, recognize data types supported by Python, and recognize and write Python code that will logically solve a given problem.

The content is taught at the Wentworth Computer Science College in Years 9 & 10, and reviewed in years 11, 12, and 13. 

GMetrix practice exams are designed to expose trainees to hands-on experience with the Python programming language, features, capabilities, writing, debugging, and maintaining well-formed, well documented Python code.
